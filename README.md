Architecture
The Cycle Share app is designed using a client-server architecture:

Mobile App:

User interface and functionalities for ride management, QR code scanning, and tracking.
Firebase:

Stores user data, ride session details, station information, and bicycle locations.
ESP32 Hardware:

Controls door locks and bicycle stations based on QR scans and sensor data.
How It Works
Register & Login: Users register through the app, creating a unique profile for tracking ride history and payment details.

Station Access: Users scan QR codes at stations to access the station, unlock bicycles and start a ride. Each station has an IR sensor for detecting bicycle parking.

Location Tracking: The app tracks the bicycle location during the ride.

End of Ride: At the destination, users scan the QR code to enter the station. The IR sensor detects bicycle parking, and the system locks the bicycle.

Data Syncing: All ride data is synced with Firebase to maintain records and update real-time statuses.

Future Enhancements
Additional Stations: Support for adding more stations across various areas.
Ride Payment Integration: Implement a payment gateway for seamless billing.
Analytics Dashboard: An admin dashboard for tracking station usage and ride statistics.
User Feedback: Enable users to rate rides and provide feedback.
